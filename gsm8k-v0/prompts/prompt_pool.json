    "Question {idx}: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nAnswer : Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. Natalia sold 48 clips in April and 24 clips in May, so altogether she sold 48 + 24 = 72 clips. The answer to the question is 72.",
    "Question {idx}: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nAnswer : Since Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting, she earns $12 / 60 = $0.2 per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned $0.2 x 50 = $10.

    "Question {idx}: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nAnswer : In the beginning, Betty has only half of the money she needs, which is 100 / 2 = $50. Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her 15 * 2 = $30. Now that she got $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, she will need $100 - $15 - $30 = $55. Since she already has $50, she needs $55 - $50 = $5 more. The answer to the question is 5.",
    "Question {idx}: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nAnswer : Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages. Since yesterday, Julie read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. There are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read. She wants to read half of the remaining pages, so she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages. The answer to the question is 42.",
    "Question {idx}: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?\nAnswer : James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week, so he writes 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 pages every week. There are 52 weeks in a year. James writes 12 pages every week, so he writes 12 * 52 = 624 pages a year. The answer to the question is 624.",
    "Question {idx}: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\nAnswer : There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, so there are 10 * 1.8 = 18 purple flowers. There are 10 yellow flowers and 18 purple flowers, so there are 10 + 18 = 28 yellow and purple flowers. There are 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, so there are 28 * 0.25 = 7 green flowers. Mark has 10 yellow flowers, 18 purple flowers, and 7 green flowers, so he has 10 + 18 + 7 = 35 flowers in his garden. The answer to the question is 35.",
    "Question {idx}: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?\nAnswer : He buys 2 large pizzas, so he has 2 * 16 = 32 slices. He buys 2 small pizzas, so he has 2 * 8 = 16 slices. There are 32 slices from the large pizzas and 16 slices from the small pizzas, so he eats 32 + 16 = 48 pieces that day. The answer to the question is 48.",
    "Question {idx}: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school. Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\nAnswer : Ken poured jelly beans into the box until the weight was 2 pounds, so the weight of the box was 2 pounds. Ken added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple, so the weight of the box was 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. He added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, which means the weight of the box was 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. Finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again, so the weight of the box was 8 * 2 = 16 pounds. The answer to the question is 16."
