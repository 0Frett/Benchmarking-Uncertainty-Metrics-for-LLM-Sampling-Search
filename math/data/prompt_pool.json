      "How many more digits does the base-10 number 87 have when expressed in base 2 than when expressed in base 3?\nAnswer : To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.  The difference between 7 digits and 5 digits is $\\boxed{2}$ digits.",
      "How many integers $n$ satisfy $0<n<60$ and $4n\\equiv 2\\pmod 6?$\nAnswer : The residue of $4n\\pmod 6$ is determined by the residue of $n\\pmod 6.$ We can build a table showing the possibilities: $$\\begin{array}{r || c * 5 {| c}}\nn\\pmod 6 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n4n\\pmod 6 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 2\n\\end{array}$$As the table shows, $4n\\equiv 2\\pmod 6$ is true when $n\\equiv 2$ or $n\\equiv 5\\pmod 6.$ Otherwise, it's false.\n\nSo, our problem is to count all $n$ between $0$ and $60$ that leave a remainder of $2$ or $5$ modulo $6.$ These integers are $$2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \\ldots, 56, 59.$$There are $\\boxed{20}$ integers in this list.",
      "If $0 \\le \\theta \\le 4 \\pi,$ find all values of $\\theta$ which satisfy\n\\[\\log_{\\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2 \\theta} \\sin \\theta = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.\nAnswer : From the given equation,\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2 \\theta \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sin \\theta.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2 \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta.\\]Then $\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta,$ so\n\\[\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta = \\sin \\theta (\\sin \\theta - \\cos \\theta) = 0.\\]Thus, $\\sin \\theta = 0$ or $\\sin \\theta = \\cos \\theta.$\n\nIf $\\sin \\theta = 0,$ then $\\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2 \\theta = 0,$ which is not allowed as the base of a logarithm.\n\nOtherwise, $\\sin \\theta = \\cos \\theta.$  Then $\\tan \\theta = 1.$  The solutions to this equation are $\\frac{\\pi}{4},$ $\\frac{5 \\pi}{4},$ $\\frac{9 \\pi}{4},$ and $\\frac{13 \\pi}{4}.$  But $\\sin \\theta$ must be positive, in order to take the logarithm of it, so the only solutions are $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{9 \\pi}{4}}.$",

      "What is the nearest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$?\nAnswer : When we expand this out, we get a bunch of terms with $\\sqrt7$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we do the following trick: Add $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\\sqrt7=\\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2+4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\\cdot5^3\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)+6\\cdot5^2\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^2-4\\cdot5\\cdot(2\\sqrt7)^3+(2\\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\\cdot5^2(2\\sqrt7)^2+(2\\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\\sqrt7)^4$.",
      "If\n$$\\frac{5x-7}{(x-1)^3} = \\frac{A}{x-1}+\\frac{B}{(x-1)^2}+\\frac{C}{(x-1)^3},$$find $A+B+C$.\nAnswer : We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x+1)^3$. This gives\n$$5x-7=A(x-1)^2+B(x-1)+C.$$Expanding and rearranging the right hand side gives\n$$5x-7 = Ax^2+(B-2A)x-A-B+C.$$By comparing coefficients we know that $A=0$, $B-2A=5$, and $-A-B+C=-7.$ So $B=5$ and $C=-7+5=-2$. Therefore $A+B+C=\\boxed{3}.$\n\nAlternatively, we can substitute $x = 2$ into the given equation, which gives us $A + B + C = 3$ right away.",
      "Find the units digit of $29 \\cdot 79 + 31 \\cdot 81$.\nAnswer : $9 \\cdot 9 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 81 + 1 = 82$, so the units digit is $\\boxed{2}$.",
      "In a lottery, a ticket costs $\\$3$, and the jackpot is worth $\\$250000$. In all, $100000$ tickets are sold, one ticket is randomly drawn, and the winner is awarded the jackpot. What are the expected winnings in dollars of buying one ticket (including the cost of the ticket)?\nAnswer : The chance of winning the jackpot is $\\frac{1}{100000}$. The value of the jackpot is $\\$250000$. The expected winnings, minus the cost of the ticket is $E = \\frac{1}{100000} \\cdot \\$250000 - \\$3 = \\$2.50-\\$3.00 = \\boxed{-\\$0.50}$.",
      "How many feet long is the shadow of a 15-foot flagpole if a 5-foot woman standing at the base of the flagpole has a shadow that is six feet long?\nAnswer : We have $5 \\text{ foot object} : 6 \\text{ foot shadow}$. We want to find the length of the shadow of a 15-foot object. Multiplying both parts of the ratio by $\\frac{15}{5}=3$, we have $3 \\cdot 5 \\text{ foot object} : 3 \\cdot 6 \\text{ foot shadow} \\Rightarrow 15 \\text{ foot object} : 18 \\text{ foot shadow}$. Thus, the shadow is $\\boxed{18}$ feet long.",
      "Express $0.\\overline{5}$ as a common fraction.\nAnswer : Let $x=0.\\overline{5}=0.5\\overline{5}$. Then $10x=5.\\overline{5}$, and so $10x-x=9x=5\\implies x=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
      "For two real values of $n$, the equation $9x^2+nx+36=0$ has exactly one solution in $x$. What is the positive value of $n$?\nAnswer : If the quadratic expression on the LHS has exactly one root in $x$, then it must be a perfect square. Dividing 9 from both sides, we have $x^2+\\frac{n}{9}x+4=0$. In order for the LHS to be a perfect square, it must factor to either $(x+2)^2=x^2+4x+4$ or $(x-2)^2=x^2-4x+4$ (since the leading coefficient and the constant term are already defined). Only the first case gives a positive value of $n$, which is $n=4\\cdot9=\\boxed{36}$.",
      "Find the second smallest positive integer that gives a remainder of $2$ when divided by $3$ and gives a remainder of $3$ when divided by $7$.\nAnswer : We start by taking $3$ and adding multiples of $7$ until we see an integer that gives a remainder of $2$ when divided by $3$. We find that $3$ and $10$ do not, but $17$ does. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 differ from 17 by a multiple of $3\\cdot7=21$. Thus the next one is $17+21=\\boxed{38}$.",
      "For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job?\nAnswer : We can rewrite the problem as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nN+x &= 97\\\\\nN+5x &= 265\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these gives: \\begin{align*}\n4x &= 265-97=168\\\\\nx &= 42.\n\\end{align*}So now $N = 97-42= 55$. So the charge for a two-hour repair job is $N+2x = \\$ 55+2\\cdot \\$ 42 = \\boxed{\\$ 139}$.",
      "Compute $115^2$ in your head.\nAnswer : We have $115^2=(110 + 5)^2 = 110^2 + 2(110)(5) +5^2 = 12100 + 1100 + 25 = \\boxed{13225}$.",

      "One cube has a volume of 343 cubic centimeters. The edge length of a second cube is three times the edge length of this first cube. What is the positive difference between the volume of the second cube and the volume of the first cube, in cubic centimeters?\nAnswer : By homothety, the second cube has a volume that is $3^3 = 27$ times that of the first.  Hence the difference in the cubes' volumes is $27\\cdot 343 - 343 = \\boxed{8918}$ cubic centimeters.",
      "Markov plays a game for three turns. On each turn, he either rolls a fair, six sided die or flips a fair coin. If he rolls a 1 or 2 on the die, he will switch to the coin on the next turn, and if he flips a tails on the coin, he will switch to the die on the next turn. If Markov starts by rolling the die, what is the probability that he will flip the coin on the third turn?\nAnswer : We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\\frac{2}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\\frac{4}{6}\\cdot \\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{2}{9}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{18}}$.",
